# Bioinformatics Notes {.unnumbered}

This book contains assorted bioinformatics related notes. It contains some 
workflows for RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and methylation analysis, as well as some 
notes describing best practices for structuring data projects, and presenting
science. We hope to keep this book updated as more useful topics come up in the
lab.
