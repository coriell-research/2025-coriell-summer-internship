# Welcome! {.unnumbered}

We're excited to have you as an intern and we hope that you'll learn a lot with
us this summer. We'll use this book as a way to teach some fundamental concepts 
before you start working on an interesting project. 

We hope to cover:

1. Some data best practices
2. The basics of programming in R
3. The basics of data visualization
4. The basics of statistical testing with simulations
5. High-dimensional data analysis
6. How to give great scientific presentations
